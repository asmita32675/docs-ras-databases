Cloud database platforms
=========================

Rackspace Database Management solutions support and provide managed
services for the following platforms:

- AWS
- Azure
- Multiple hosted private clouds
- Dedicated environments in one of Rackspace’s global data centers
- Dedicated and cloud-based VMWare virtualized environments or hybrid cloud
  solutions

Amazon Web Services
--------------------

Amazon Web Services (AWS) database management services enable clients to
quickly leverage cloud database services on a managed database platform. During
the engagement process, a consultation phase takes place to design an
appropriate solution that combines AWS and Rackspace Managed Services to meet
both business and technical requirements. Rackspace’s management tools
facilitate data protection and restore operations. Rackspace deploys and
maintains a client’s database, and manages the environment, including
installations, patches, upgrades, and data backup.

The Rackspace approach considers client-specific requirements when
guiding their journey to the cloud and utilizes the following AWS databases
and services:

- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), including Aurora
- Amazon Redshift
- Amazon DynamoDB

Rackspace employs numerous tools to optimize these services including the AWS
Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT), the AWS Database Migration Service, and more.

Amazon Relational Database Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a web service that facilitates
deploying, operating, and scaling a relational database in the AWS cloud. The
AWS RDS system provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity and database
management tasks. Rackspace solution architects and the Database Management
team help design and manage databases deployed in this manner for clients with
a best-practice approach for security, architecture, and read/write
requirements. Rackspace supports AWS RDS deployed with MySQL, Oracle, SQL
Server, Aurora, and PostgreSQL—all with the stack of database engines, compute,
scale, and storage. RDS enables HA designs with Multi-AZ Deployment and read
replicas that can enhance the availability and scale of solutions. Rackspace
assists clients in determining a solution that meets their requirements.

Rackspace is an Amazon RDS Migration Partner.


Microsoft Azure
----------------

As a Microsoft Partner and provider of managed services for Azure, Rackspace is
in a unique position to meet client needs in deploying databases on the
Microsoft Azure platform. The Azure SQL Database service provides a relational
database as a service with scalability, high availability with SLAs, data
protection, replication, and restoration services. A wide variety of use cases
are met with the service, whether for applications built on .NET, or for
combining the Azure cloud database with on-premises, dedicated hardware.
