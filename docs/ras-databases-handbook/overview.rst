The Lead DBA
----------------

Every RAS account is assigned a lead DBA. A lead DBA is a highly skilled
and experienced database administrator who becomes the expert on the data
platform. They provide the strategic oversight for the data plane,
understanding the customer’s business need and ensuring that Rackspace remains
focused on the customer’s desired outcome. The lead DBA works closely with
the Service Delivery team, processing regular database health reviews and
capacity reviews, which are then provided to the customer during regular
monthly or quarterly business reviews. Most lead DBAs are US-based and
available during normal business hours. However, lead DBAs in other
geographies or time zones can also be available.

The Database Operations team
-----------------------------

The lead DBAs are supported by the DBAs in our 24x7x365 Database Operations
team. These DBAs handle all alert triage, simple maintenances, and any
break-fix troubleshooting that might occur during the life of the database.
They also, with the direction provided by the lead DBA, process all
scheduled maintenances for the database platform. The members of the Database
Operations team are full-time Rackspace employees that are based in our offices
in India.
